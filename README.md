# Checkers Game Project

## Overview

The Checkers Game Project is a collaborative effort aimed at creating a classic checkers game with advanced features. The project involves the integration of the MinMax algorithm to allow players to engage in challenging matches against an AI opponent. Additionally, we have developed an intuitive game interface using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library.

## Features

- **MinMax Algorithm**: We have successfully integrated the MinMax algorithm to enable AI gameplay. This allows players to test their skills against a challenging computer opponent.

- **SDL Game Interface**: Our team designed and implemented a user-friendly game interface using the SDL library, providing intuitive controls and appealing graphics for an enhanced gaming experience.

- **Collaborative Teamwork**: Throughout the project, we worked cohesively as a team, pooling our skills and resources to create a compelling checkers game. We effectively managed stress and challenges, ensuring we reached our desired outcome.
